# McTazze
McTazze is a C# program that generates random McDonalds coffee promocode and add them to a list of registered account (passing emails and cookie parameters).

Thanks to FFcoupon (and Giacomo) for the coupon generator source code (previously in python, I translated it to C#).

McDonalds added a Google Captcha in coupon insert after 1 month, so this program is for educational purposes only, that's why I decided to release his full code today.

The list of restaurants in Location.cs it was obtained thanks to [my other project McCafe-Locations](https://github.com/ErikPelli/McCafe-Locations).
